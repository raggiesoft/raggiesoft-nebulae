/**
 * AETHEL SAGA LORE: CHARACTERS (FIGURES OF LEGEND)
 * 
 * ARCHITECTURAL CONTEXT:
 * This file presents the "Dramatis Personae" for the Aethel Saga universe.
 * It operates within the `aethel` site context, applying the global
 * fantasy theme configuration.
 *
 * KEY FEATURES:
 * - Context Flagging: Sets `$currentSite = 'aethel'` to inform global wrappers
 *   or navigation about the active domain context.
 * - Thematic UI: Shares the `aethel-theme` and `tome-container` styles for 
 *   visual consistency across lore pages.
 * - Structured Content: Uses Bootstrap rows and columns to pair character 
 *   names with descriptions.
 *
 * MAINTENANCE NOTES:
 * - Ensure `$currentSite` matches the expected string in the header/footer includes.
 * - Character additions should follow the `col-md-6` layout or similar grid rules
 *   to avoid breaking responsive flows.

                <h5 class="text-muted fst-italic mb-3">"The Golden Avatar"</h5>
                <p>
                    Kaelan believes he is just a man born under a lucky star. He is wrong. He <strong class="text-uppercase">is</strong> the physical manifestation of <strong>Sol-Aura</strong>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    His "rage" is not human anger; it is solar flaring. His strength is not muscle; it is gravity. Malakor cannot simply kill him, for doing so would destroy half the power source he needs to rule. He must be captured, contained, and controlled.
                </p>

                <h5 class="text-muted fst-italic mb-3">"The Silver Avatar"</h5>
                <p>
                    She <strong class="text-uppercase">is</strong> the physical manifestation of <strong>Lun-Argent</strong>. Her "Hearth-Song" is the literal resonance of the silver star. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>The Captivity:</strong> Malakor's raid on Sunstead was a partial failure. He intended to seize both stars at once. Having only secured the Silver, he keeps her alive in the Highest Tower not as a hostage, but as bait. He knows that due to their celestial gravity, the Gold Sun (Kaelan) <em>must</em> eventually come to the Silver.

                <p>
                    Before the Gloom fell, Seraphina was Kaelan's betrothed. She represented the "normal" life he thought he wanted. Malakor corrupted her with promises of eternal beauty and order—things a dying village could never provide. She now serves as Malakor's voice, trying to lure Kaelan into surrendering his power willingly.
