 *   for text and imagery.
 *

                <p>
                    Following her fall from the Delaney Street portico roof, Jessica sustained a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). While her cognitive and analytical functions made a flawless recovery, the neurological trauma permanently altered how her brain processes light.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-0">
                    To navigate harsh or unpredictable lighting environments—whether the fluorescent glare of the Quantum corporate campus or flashing transit center lights—she strictly wears custom, darkly tinted prescription glasses. They act as a vital sensory shield against debilitating migraines, allowing her to maintain her analytical focus and corporate armor without visual fatigue.

                <p>
                    In 2006, Jessica is the logistical lead on <strong>Project Mercury</strong>—a highly classified, multi-billion-dollar infrastructure initiative. Mercury is the architectural foundation for Quantum's leap into global cloud computing and frictionless data synchronization.

                <p class="mb-0">
                    She is the ruthless logistical architect ensuring the server farms and cross-team dependencies deploy on schedule. Her flawless execution of Mercury's backend infrastructure is what catches the attention of the Department of Defense, eventually leading to her aggressive "SME Capture" and deployment to the NAVSTA Norfolk Blockhouse to overhaul SIPRNet.

                <p>
                    In the mid-2000s Pacific Northwest tech scene, the dress code was "aggressively casual." A high-level TPM sitting at her desk in Redmond wears jeans, layered long-sleeve tees, or a North Face fleece. Jessica flawlessly executes this aesthetic (as seen in her portrait wearing <em>The Stardust Engine</em> band tee). It radiates an effortless authority; she doesn't need a uniform in her own territory because her raw competence speaks for itself.

                    <strong>The Deployment Uniform (The Armor)</strong><br>
                    Jessica strictly reserves her branded, structured Quantum polo shirt (complete with her name and title embroidered) for hostile field deployments. She consciously uses it to switch into an operational mindset. When extracting her brother from an abuser, she uses the polo as "corporate armor." By showing up in her official uniform, she refuses to engage in an emotional domestic dispute; instead, she becomes an immovable corporate entity executing a logistical extraction, completely short-circuiting the abuser's manipulative playbook.
