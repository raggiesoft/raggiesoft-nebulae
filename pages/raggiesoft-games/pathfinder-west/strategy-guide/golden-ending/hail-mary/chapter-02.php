/**
 * ARCHITECTURE & PURPOSE:
 * This page contains the narrative prose and strategic guide notes for Chapter 2 of the 
 * "Pasco Hail Mary" strategy guide for Pathfinder West. It covers the audio cipher mechanics,
 * map routing (Exit 190), and fuel/budget management systems.
 *
 * MAINTENANCE NOTES:
 * - The prose is wrapped in standard HTML5 `<article>` tags for semantic structure.
 * - The `Guide Notes` section uses Bootstrap cards and explains the underlying game mechanics associated with the chapter's narrative events.
 * - Ensure `$cdnBaseUrl` is in scope if images are added later, though this specific chapter currently only uses typography.
 * - Uses `narrative-stepper.php` for sequential chapter navigation.

        <p class="text-muted fs-5">Saturday, April 1, 2006 — I-64 West into North Carolina</p>
    </header>

    <article class="narrative-prose fs-5 lh-lg">
        <p>The Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel was a parking lot. Roxy white-knuckled the steering wheel of the sedan, glaring at the glowing green digits on the dashboard clock. They had lost an hour to Tanya's Newport decoy, and the ghost bus was already miles ahead of them on I-64 West.</p>

        <p>"Put the CD in," Roxy said, not taking her eyes off the bumper of the minivan in front of them. "The one we found on the dresser. Let's see if there's a reason Jason circled that track."</p>

        <p>Allison popped open the jewel case and slid <em>Book 1: The Long Road West</em> into the dashboard stereo. For the next hour, as they finally cleared the tunnel traffic and opened up the throttle toward Richmond, the car was filled with the heavy, industrial rock opera of The Paper Wall. Roxy occasionally asked Allison to flip the receiver over to the AM band to check for state patrol radar traps, but they always switched seamlessly back to the album.</p>

        <p>It wasn't just music. As the miles blurred past, the horrifying realization set in: the album was a thematic roadmap.</p>

        <p>When Track 6, <em>Nashville</em>, pumped through the speakers, Allison gasped. The lyrics described being trapped on a westward bus, drowning in unspoken fear. "He's not going up the coast," Allison said, her voice trembling. "They're transferring to the Tennessee corridor. He's heading to the Midwest."</p>

        <p>"Then we aren't stopping at the Richmond terminal to ask questions," Alanna said from the backseat, tracing a line on the Rand McNally atlas. "Take Exit 190. Get onto I-95 South—the old Richmond-Petersburg Turnpike. We can bypass the Appalachian mountains entirely, merge onto I-85, and shoot straight for North Carolina to catch I-40 into Knoxville."</p>

        <p>Roxy nodded, gripping the wheel tighter. They let the disc play in full. When they finally reached Track 15, <em>A Night in Kent</em>, the destination locked into place. Kent. Tanya's aunt lived in Kent, Washington. The West Coast. Roxy felt a cold shiver run down her spine. The New England theory was dead. Tanya was taking him as far away from his support system as physically possible.</p>

        <p>Allison ejected the first disc and slid in <em>Book 2: The Journey Home</em>. Track 1, <em>Curbstone, 4 AM</em>, echoed through the cabin. The song painted a vivid, agonizing picture of the protagonist physically shattered, starving, and locked out in the freezing rain of a Kent neighborhood.</p> 
        
        <p>The stakes were suddenly absolute. This wasn't just a rescue mission to bring him home from a bad trip; it was a matter of survival. If they didn't catch that bus and pull him out of Tanya's grip, the psychological damage to Jason would be permanent. They had to save him.</p>

        <p>As Roxy merged the sedan onto I-85 South past Petersburg, her eyes dropped to the fuel gauge. They had started with a full tank of gas in Virginia Beach. After the detour to Portsmouth, the time wasted driving out to Island 1 on the CBBT, the stop-and-go traffic at the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel, and the heavy weight of three adults with luggage pressing down the suspension, the needle was already dipping below the halfway mark.</p>

        <p>"We can make it across the border," Alanna said, calculating the mileage from the backseat. "But we'll need to hit a travel center somewhere around Durham or Greensboro before we merge onto I-40."</p>

        <p>"When we stop, should we see if they sell radar detectors?" Allison asked, glancing over at the speedometer. "We're still in Virginia right now, so they're completely illegal here. The state troopers don't play around. But once we hit North Carolina, we're in the clear to buy one."</p>

        <p>Roxy eased her foot slightly off the accelerator, keeping the needle strictly hovering over the speed limit. "Yeah, but what happens when we bring Jason back? We can't drive into Hampton Roads with a radar detector sitting on the dash."</p>

        <p>"We just unplug it and lock it in the trunk before we cross the state line," Alanna reasoned. "If it's in the trunk, it's inaccessible, which makes it perfectly legal to transport. The real question is the budget. Those things aren't cheap. If we drop two hundred bucks on electronics in Carolina, we're going to feel the pinch when we need gas in the Midwest."</p>

        <p>Roxy chewed the inside of her cheek. She knew they couldn't afford a speeding ticket, but she also knew the tour fund was draining fast. She'd have to make the call when they hit the truck stop.</p>

                <li><strong>The Exit 190 Skip:</strong> Decoding the album while driving is a massive tactical advantage. Because <em>Nashville</em> confirms the bus is heading toward Tennessee, you can skip the 30-minute time penalty of investigating the Richmond terminal. Selecting Exit 190 onto I-95 South allows you to bypass the Blue Ridge Mountains entirely.</li>
                <li><strong>The Sequential Lock:</strong> You must listen to <em>Book 1</em> before <em>Book 2</em>. <em>A Night in Kent</em> locks the destination, but hearing <em>Curbstone, 4 AM</em> provides the narrative urgency. If you try to skip straight to Disc 2 without the narrative context, the music will fail to unlock the destination marker on your map.</li>
                <li><strong>The Weight Penalty:</strong> Notice the fuel gauge dropping! The "Full Band" party composition (Roxy, Allison, and Alanna) adds significant weight to a standard 2004 sedan. Your fuel efficiency takes a 10-15% hit, forcing an earlier gas stop in North Carolina.</li>
                <li><strong>The Radar Dilemma:</strong> Keep your speed slider in check on I-85 South. Radar detectors cannot be purchased or used until you cross the state line into North Carolina. Once unlocked, you must weigh the high financial cost of the item against the massive reduction in the police encounter RNG for the rest of the game.</li>
