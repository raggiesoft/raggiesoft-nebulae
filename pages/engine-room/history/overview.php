 * Description:
 * A dual-purpose overview page presenting the real-world creation context 
 * (portfolio disclosure, AI generation info) alongside the extensive fictional 
 * universe timeline for Engine Room Records and its artists.
 *
 * Architecture & Maintenance Notes:
 * - Employs a custom Web Component (<wa-card>) for the real-world disclosure block.
 * - Dynamically renders the narrative timeline by iterating through predefined 
 *   $props arrays and including the _timeline-node.php component for each era.
 * - Future additions to the timeline should follow the same $props array structure 
 *   (color, year, title, subtitle, content, etc.) and include the node component.

                    <p>For their 1989 sophomore album, <em>Neon Hearts</em>, Apex Records demanded pure brand consistency. Terrified by industry controversy, the executives demanded an absurdly short, manic 1:54 bubblegum pop track ("Side by Side") to ensure the album felt "safe."</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">But the fans were catching on. When Apex begrudgingly allowed a "one-two punch" of pure rock on Side B ("Chain Reaction" and "Not Your Doll"), the tracks became immediate fan-favorites.

Desperate to stop the PR bleeding, Apex Records capitulated to all of Holly\'s demands, returning their master tapes and copyrights, which she used to formally establish <strong>Engine Room Records, LLC</strong>.

                    <p>In 1997, The Stardust Engine released <em>Hard Reset</em>. This massive, two-disc progressive rock epic was Engine Room Records\' first foray into traditional commercial distribution. Holly O\'Connell set the retail price for the double-album at a staggering $13.99, accomplishing this by weaponizing the Forger Nation Trust\'s risk-free U.S. Treasury yields to subsidize manufacturing.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Terrified by this market disruption, a coalition of major labels—led by Apex Records—filed a massive antitrust injunction. Holly dismantled their coalition in federal court, proving it was simply a superior, privately funded business model. The injunction was dismissed, and <em>Hard Reset</em> dominated the global charts.</p>

The re-release resurrected the "lost" masterpiece of 1983, allowing a new generation to discover the haunting, atmospheric synth-pop that had defined an era.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Under the protective banner of Engine Room Records, Rhys and Claire were finally given the creative freedom and financial backing to begin work on their massive concept album, a rock opera detailing their intricate 1883 narrative lore.</p>

                    <p>In 2001, Engine Room Records independently resurrected and released <em>Midnight Drivers</em>. Because the title track was the only song actually written during the fraught 1987 sessions, the band had to build an entire retro-engineered album around it from scratch in 2001.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Side A acts as an explosive, high-speed synth-pop prologue. This brilliant pacing sets the stage for a vibrant night out in the city, allowing the raw, untouched 1987 master of the title track to open Side B with maximum impact. It pulls the listener out of the bright lights and directly into the dark, finding sanctuary in a moving car at night.</p>
