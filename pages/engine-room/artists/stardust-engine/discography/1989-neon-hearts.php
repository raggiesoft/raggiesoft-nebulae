                The 1989 "Panic" Album
            </p>
            <p class="lead text-secondary">
                The band's sophomore album, released in 1989. Its creation was defined by Apex Records' sheer panic following the <strong>Cydele</strong> "Sermon" controversy.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted">
                Terrified of controversy, the studio demanded the "safest," most polished synth-pop album possible. The result is a fascinating document of "Studio Overcorrection" vs. "Artist Rebellion," featuring some of the band's safest pop hits alongside their angriest rock protests.

                    Apex originally demanded a "religious pop" song to compete with <strong>Cydele's</strong> upcoming <em>Sermon</em> album. When the <em>Sermon</em> video controversy broke (with its "burning crosses"), the label panicked and buried the demo. It wouldn't be heard until the 2007 <em>Lost Sounds</em> compilation.
