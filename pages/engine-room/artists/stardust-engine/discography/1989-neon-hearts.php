 * 
 * ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW:
 * This view partial renders the narrative for the 1989 "Neon Hearts" album, detailing
 * the label-mandated "Studio Overcorrection".
 *
 * MAINTENANCE NOTES:
 * - The visual theme utilizes `$props['variant'] = 'pact'` (pink) to represent the
 *   restrictive "Apex era" of the band's history.
 * - Uses shared components `_album-art-header.php` and `_tracklist-downloader.php`.
 * - "The Canceled Track" section is a lore box providing context for the `Lost Sounds`
 *   compilation.

                The 1989 "Panic" Album
            </p>
            <p class="lead text-secondary">
                The band's sophomore album, released in 1989. Its creation was defined by Apex Records' sheer panic following the <strong>Cydele</strong> "Sermon" controversy.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted">
                Terrified of controversy, the studio demanded the "safest," most polished synth-pop album possible. The result is a fascinating document of "Studio Overcorrection" vs. "Artist Rebellion," featuring some of the band's safest pop hits alongside their angriest rock protests.

                    Apex originally demanded a "religious pop" song to compete with <strong>Cydele's</strong> upcoming <em>Sermon</em> album. When the <em>Sermon</em> video controversy broke (with its "burning crosses"), the label panicked and buried the demo. It wouldn't be heard until the 2007 <em>Lost Sounds</em> compilation.

                    Before Apex Records drowned the title track in heavy synth-pop gloss, "Neon Hearts" was originally written as a tender, intimate ballad by Ryan and Cassidy. You can hear this rare early version (just a brother and sister jamming with a piano and acoustic guitar) on the
