                            In 1986, long before they had a record deal, the five members of The Stardust Engine entered a student contest to replace the dated, traditional marching band song used for the CPI football team's field entrance.

                            They didn't write a fight song; they wrote a weapon. <em>"Ignition"</em> was designed as a heavy, industrial rock anthem meant to strike fear into opposing teams. It won by a landslide.

                            <em>The Stomp</em> was never part of the original 1986 sheet music. It started organically in the student section (specifically among the engineering students in the endzone) who began rhythmically stomping their feet on the concrete bleachers to keep time during the song's slow, building intro.

                            Over the decades, it blossomed into a terrifying 60,000-person synchronized ritual. Today, "The Stomp" is so loud and aggressive that it registers on the geology department's local seismographs. You cannot imagine the song without it.
