/**
 * ARCHITECTURAL OVERVIEW:
 * This file serves as the presentation view for the "Mile Marker 98 [Moon 2]" album.
 * It integrates shared components such as the album art header and tracklist downloader,
 * and it includes context-specific HTML (like the 'wa-card' Web Component) to surface
 * deep lore related to the "Crash of '90".
 * 
 * Future Maintenance Notes:
 * - The web components (`<wa-card>`, `<wa-badge>`, `<wa-button>`) must be present in the 
 *   global document head for rendering.
 * - This album is conceptually linked to "Sanctuary (Zero-G)" as a counterweight. If you
 *   add navigation, ensure these two albums link back to each other logically.

                Blistering, distorted electric guitars and aggressive rock energy. A visceral, high-friction confrontation with the trauma of The Crash of '90. Ryan transposed the trauma of his real-life T-10 paralysis into the dark cosmos of space, fighting the crushing gravity of his reality through blistering rock anthems.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted">
                Driven by Ryan O'Connell, this record represents the raw, chaotic energy and unresolved anger of The Stardust Engine. It serves as the explosive, high-friction counterweight to its atmospheric sibling, Sanctuary (Zero-G). Thematically, this is a show being put on by the Engine Room Records Planetarium.

                            Ryan absolutely loathed his new wheelchair, but he would do anything for his sisters when they asked him to go for a walk in the ward. Read the historical archive detailing the biographical events of December 10, 1990, that served as the harrowing inspiration for this album.
