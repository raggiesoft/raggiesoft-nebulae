                The 1987 Debut Album
            </p>
            <p class="lead text-secondary">
                The debut album from The Stardust Engine, released in 1987. While a commercial success, its creation was defined by the "cold war" between the band and their label, Apex Records.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted">
                The album is a sonic battlefield. Apex Records wanted a polished "Stardust" synth-pop record to compete on the charts. The band wanted to unleash their "Engine" rock energy. The result is a fascinating mix of studio-mandated pop and the band's own "malicious compliance" tracks.

                            Originally part of the band's early demo tape used to shop for labels, this darkwave track was flatly rejected by Apex executives for being "too melancholic" and "off-brand." Kept locked in the vault, the raw 1987 master eventually became the anchor for a massive retro-engineered concept album fourteen years later.

                            While included on the cassette and CD releases, Apex Records gleefully cut Ryan's 1:35 punk-inspired track from the physical LP, citing that Side B was "too long." They subsequently mastered the remaining rock tracks quietly to neuter their energy.
