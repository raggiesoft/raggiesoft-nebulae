            </p>
            <p class="lead text-secondary">
                Released in 1990 to capitalize on the <em>Neon Hearts</em> tour, this live EP is a snapshot of the band at the height of their "cold war" with Apex Records.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted">
                The 26-minute runtime features a strictly studio-mandated setlist. While the performance captures the band's raw talent, the release is infamous for its <strong>engineering sabotage</strong>. Apex engineers intentionally altered the board feed to erase Cassidy's contributions, attempting to rebrand the band as a male-fronted rock act.

                        Track 1 ("The Stardust Engine") became the central piece of evidence in the 1994 <em>Friction</em> trial. In the intro, Ryan explicitly introduces Cassidy as <strong>"my sister, Cassidy!"</strong>

                        This 10-second clip proved definitively that executive Julian Vance's defense—that he "didn't know" they were siblings—was a lie.

                    <p class="card-text text-muted small">
                        Cassidy performed the leitmotif live. She heard it in her monitors. However, forensic analysis of the master tapes reveals her synth channel was <strong>muted at the board</strong>.

                    <p class="card-text text-muted small mb-0">
                        The result is a "Ghost Track." The song has holes where the melody should be, leaving Ryan's guitar to call out to a silence that never answers.

                    <p class="card-text text-muted small">
                        Like the synth, Cassidy's vocal mic was cut from the main mix. She is only audible due to <strong>microphone bleed</strong>.

                    <p class="card-text text-muted small mb-0">
                        You only hear her voice when Ryan physically moves stage-left to stand next to her. Her vocals are being picked up <em>by his microphone</em>, creating a distant, haunting harmony that fans—and Cassidy—wouldn't discover until the album was released.

                                Cassidy fought to cut this song from the setlist. Singing about abandonment while the label was actively trying to separate her from her brother was psychologically devastating.

                            <p class="card-text text-muted small">
                                <strong>Aftermath:</strong> Immediately following the show, Cassidy suffered a severe breakdown backstage. Ryan had to hold her in a deep-pressure hug for twenty minutes to bring her back to baseline.

                                STATUS: RETIRED. Because of the distress caused by this performance, the band vowed never to play this song live again.
