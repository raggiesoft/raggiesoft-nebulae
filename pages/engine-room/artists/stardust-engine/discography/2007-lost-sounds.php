                    This alternate version of "The Stardust Engine" was one of the original demos shopped around to record companies when the band formed in 1986. Apex Records signed them but rejected this version, burying the final studio version as track 13 on 1987's <em>Electric Color</em>. The band famously despises Apex for what happened to them during the 1992 label dispute. For this vault release, they officially retitled this early cut "(The Rejected Mix)" instead of naming Apex Records directly, serving as a quiet nod to their lingering resentment.

                    A 1986 deep cut demo that Apex Records threw out during the <em>Electric Color</em> selection process because it was deemed "too heavy on the synths and too light on the pop".

It was ultimately deemed too depressing for the <em>Friction</em> era and was kept locked away. Its inclusion on <em>Lost Sounds</em> is a poignant reminder of the darkest period in the band's history.

The sheer anger in Ryan's guitar work makes this a standout deep cut. It was never intended for public release, serving strictly as a therapeutic middle finger to the studio executives.

                    A brand new track recorded specifically for the 2007 <em>Lost Sounds</em> compilation, intentionally designed to simulate the stripped-down, acoustic music Ryan and Cassidy were making together back in 1985 (before their cousins Evan and Tyler joined to form The Stardust Engine). After digging through years of painful, heavily-manufactured Apex Records history, they wanted to return to their roots. Written and recorded in a single afternoon with just an acoustic guitar and a piano, "Our Own Frequency" is a triumphant, intimate declaration of their bond as brother and sister. It is the exact kind of acoustic scratch track they always wanted to make, completely free of label interference.

    An epic 80s power ballad duet about finding love and safety after a difficult past. Features a male and female vocalist, a powerful piano intro, massive drums with gated reverb, and a soaring electric guitar solo. The song builds from gentle verses to a huge, heartfelt, and dramatic chorus. It is the signature song for John and Megan (characters the band created in 1986). It represents John finding a safe harbor with his wife Megan after suffering and finally breaking free from an abusive past relationship. It was put on their early demo cassette to shop around, but no studio wanted it.

    A powerful, defiant 80s rock anthem and duet showing the protective bond between John and his fraternal twin sister, Erin. It captures the moment a predator starts making the wrong moves on Erin. John recognizes the predator's manipulative tactics because of his own past trauma and abuse, unleashing his analytical fury to shut it down. Erin's bridge is a fierce and assertive plea to escape, delivered with raw rock energy. The final chorus is their unified, protective roar—John declaring "Not Her, NEVER AGAIN!" to ensure his sister doesn't suffer what he did.
