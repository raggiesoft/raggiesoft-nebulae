 * ENGINE ROOM RECORDS - 1997 HARD RESET ALBUM VIEW
 * ============================================================================
 * 
 * ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW:
 * This view component renders the narrative and tracklist details for the 1997
 * "Hard Reset" double album. It utilizes shared components like `_album-art-header.php`
 * and `_tracklist-downloader.php`.
 *
 * MAINTENANCE NOTES:
 * - $pageTitle and $album_path_web are crucial for routing and asset paths.
 * - The component configuration uses $props['variant'] = 'axiom' (orange) to represent
 *   the "Freedom era". Do not alter this color mapping without consulting the brand guide.
 * - Lore integration highlights Holly's "$13.99 Retail War" and connects to the
 *   internal court case story page. Keep URLs in sync with the story routing.

            <p class="lead text-secondary">
                This wasn't a mail-order cassette; it was a triumphant, unbothered declaration of absolute independence. The band's first retail release on their own label, <strong>Engine Room Records, LLC</strong>.

            <p class="text-muted">
                While <em>The Warehouse Tapes</em> (1995) was a raw "bat signal" to the underground fans, <em>Hard Reset</em> is a professional, two-disc masterpiece. Disc 1 is a relentless, driving rock record reclaiming their terrestrial past, while Disc 2 cuts the engines and floats into the zero-gravity ambient space of their future. They aren't scared of failing anymore; they are ready to conquer the industry on their own terms.

                    A massive, three-song narrative arc consisting of <em>The Stardust Engine</em>, <em>Hard Reset</em>, and <em>Brand New Scene</em>.

                    Driven by a massive gated-reverb snare and a relentless 130 BPM tempo, this is the pure, unapologetic rock anthem Apex Records refused to let them release. It officially canonizes their manager, Holly O'Connell, within the music itself.

                    An arena-shaking power ballad that completely rewrites their biggest 1987 pop hit. They shed the old theme of codependency in favor of absolute equality: "I'm not the anchor, you're not the sail / We're just a ship that will prevail."

                    Completely shedding the hard rock guitars of Disc 1, this multi-part instrumental and prog-rock epic explores the silent vacuum of deep space. It culminates in <em>The Spectrum (True Color)</em>, a sprawling reimagining of their old terrestrial love song into a cosmic observation where Cassidy's ethereal vocals finally drift into the mix at the 2:21 mark.

                    These sibling tracks act as dueling astronomical concepts. Cassidy leads <em>Tidal Lock</em>, an upbeat 80s synth-pop track about unbreakable loyalty. Ryan then answers with his sole vocal performance on the second disc with <em>Roche Limit</em>, shattering the calm with heavy guitars to describe the fatal attraction of being torn apart by gravity.

                <p class="small text-muted mb-2">
                    Following the family's $2.04 Billion lottery windfall in 1996, Manager and CEO Holly O'Connell parked the net payout in U.S. Treasury Bonds. Generating roughly $37 Million a year in risk-free interest, Holly used a fraction of those monthly yields to completely subsidize the pressing of the massive double-album. 
                </p>
                <p class="small text-muted mb-3">
                    This strategic maneuver allowed <strong>Engine Room Records&trade;</strong> to sell <em>Hard Reset</em> at retail for only $13.99, completely undercutting the $24.99 industry standard for double-disc releases. When a cartel of major labels—led by Apex Records—panicked and filed an emergency federal antitrust injunction for "predatory pricing," Holly O'Connell walked into court and defended the label <em>pro se</em> (without outside counsel). By entering the Treasury yields into the public record, she proved the price point wasn't an illegal monopoly tactic; it was just a vastly superior business model. The case was thrown out.
