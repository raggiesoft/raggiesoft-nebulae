 * Component: The Stardust Engine - Re-Ignition (2015) Discography Page
 * 
 * 1. COMPONENT PURPOSE:
 *    - Renders the detail page for the reunion album "Re-Ignition".
 *    - Incorporates standard tracklist downloads and extensive lore notes.
 * 
 * 2. DESIGN & STYLING:
 *    - Standard Bootstrap grid architecture.
 *    - The `_album-art-header.php` uses the `axiom` variant (Orange/Cyan) to match the Fire/Engine thematic rebirth.
 *    - Uses a `list-group-flush` with transparent backgrounds for clean track-by-track liner notes.
 * 
 * 3. TECHNICAL & INTEGRATION NOTES:
 *    - Relies on `$album_path_web` to instruct `_tracklist-downloader.php` where to find the JSON metadata.
 * 
 * 4. FUTURE MAINTENANCE:
 *    - When updating or adding liner notes, use the standard `list-group-item` structure provided below.

            <p class="lead text-secondary">
                The silence is broken. After the seven-year "Burnout Hiatus" (2008-2014), The Stardust Engine returned to the studio to light the fires once more.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted">
                *Re-Ignition* is widely considered a massive return to form. It sheds the weariness of the *Long Way Home* era and recaptures the dual identity that defined them: the soaring "Stardust" melodies of Cassidy's synths and the raw "Engine" power of Ryan's guitar, finally balanced in perfect harmony.

                    The title track is a piece of history reclaimed. In 1992, during the disastrous sessions for the canceled <em>Friction</em> album, the band wrote a heavy, driving instrumental riff intended to simulate the shaking of a spacecraft during re-entry.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text text-muted">
                    Because of the scandal with executive Julian Vance, that song was never recorded. For 23 years, the riff existed only in the band's memory. For this reunion, they finally dusted it off, stripped away the trauma of the past, and recorded it as it was always intended: a song about surviving the fire and coming home.

                    "We are the cosmos, we are the fire!" The opening explosion of the album. It serves as a mission statement for their return: they didn't burn out; they just needed to refuel.

                <p class="mb-0">
                    A haunting synth-rock ballad led by Cassidy. It addresses the "Hiatus Years" directly, describing the feeling of "floating in the void" without the music that had defined their lives since they were teenagers.

                    A rhythmic, bass-heavy track featuring Evan and Tyler. It pays homage to their "Ironhead" roots at CPI, using industrial percussion samples to create a "foundry" atmosphere that recalls their 1986 anthem "Ignition."
