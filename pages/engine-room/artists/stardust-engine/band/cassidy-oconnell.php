            <p class="fs-5 text-white-75">
                The "Anchor". Cassidy (Age 21 in 1987) is the emotional center of the band. Classically trained on piano, she brings the cinematic, orchestral texture that defines the band's "Space Rock" sound.
            </p>
            <p class="text-white-75">
                While Ryan provides the raw energy (The Engine), Cassidy provides the gravity. Her relationship with her brother is the core dynamic of the group; she is his "Safe Person," and he is hers. Their vocal harmonies—often described as "telepathic"—are the result of a lifetime of non-verbal communication.
            </p>

            <h3 class="fw-bold mt-5 mb-3 text-white">The "Friction" Survivor</h3>
            <p class="text-white-75">
                In 1992, Cassidy was the primary target of the "Friction" scandal. When Apex executives attempted to exploit her bond with Ryan for a marketing campaign, she didn't crumble—she went silent.
            </p>
            <p class="text-white-75">
                She famously refused to speak to *any* press for three years (1992-1995), communicating only through her lyrics on *The Warehouse Tapes*. Songs like "The Cage" and "Ad Astra" are her direct response to the trauma: a declaration that she would rather flee to the stars than sell her soul on Earth.

                    <p class="text-white-75">
                        In 1996, four years after the band declared independence, they were driving home from a gig in Lexington, VA. They stopped at a gas station in <strong>Daleville</strong> for late-night snacks and fuel. On a whim, Cassidy bought a "Quick Pick" ticket for the <em>American Dream</em> lottery. She let the machine pick the numbers, simply liking the visual pattern they made on the screen.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white-75">
                        The next morning, while reading the newspaper, it slowly dawned on her: she had matched <strong>all numbers in correct order</strong>, including the Dream Ball.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white-75">
                        She didn't scream. She walked into the kitchen, handed the ticket to her sister Holly, and said, "Build us a fortress so we never have to be hurt again." The jackpot was <strong>$2.04 Billion</strong>.
