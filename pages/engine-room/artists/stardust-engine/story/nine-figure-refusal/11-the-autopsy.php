                    <p>
                        The room was vibrating with tension. Cassidy was on the floor, shielded by Ryan's wheelchair. Evan and Tyler stood like bouncers, blocking the executives from the family.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jameson Frost, however, was pacing. He looked at the huddled family with undisguised disgust.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "This... this is unbelievable," Jameson sputtered, looking at Holly. "We are talking about a nine-figure deal, and she’s having a tantrum over a remix? This is exactly why you need professional management. You are emotionally unstable."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Holly O'Connell hadn't moved.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She sat at the head of the mahogany table, her pen resting on her notebook. She thought about why she was here. She wasn't here for the money. She was on vacation. She was supposed to be at the Santa Monica Pier.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-body-emphasis fw-bold">
                        She had taken this meeting for one reason: Disrespect.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Jameson," Holly said. The voice cut through the chaos like a razor blade.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jameson turned to her. "What?"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Sit down," Holly commanded.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Excuse me? I am the Vice President of—"
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-body-emphasis fw-bold">
                        "I said sit down."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It wasn't a request. It was the tone of a CEO addressing a subordinate. Frost, bewildered by the sudden shift in gravity, sank into his chair.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Do you know why we're here, Jameson?" Holly asked, opening her laptop.

                            Holly didn't ask for a cable. She opened her network settings and selected <strong>"Join Other Network..."</strong>
                            <br><br>
                            The IT Director, watching from the corner, frowned. There were no other networks. But Holly's fingers flew across the keys, manually typing a hidden SSID that didn't broadcast its existence: <code>PRP_MGT_VLAN_01</code>.
                            <br><br>
                            She dropped in the sixteen-character master key and hit <code>ENTER</code>. Connected.
                            <br><br>
                            She hit <code>CTRL+K</code> to open the <strong>Quantum Cast</strong> menu. The massive 85-inch monitor on the wall—hardware leased from Pacific Rim and sitting on that same hidden management VLAN—recognized the command immediately. Following its hard-coded protocols, the device prioritized the Landlord signal over the Tenant signal, dumping Frost's HDMI connection and instantly mirroring her screen.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        The giant screen flickered black. Jameson's "Synergy" slide vanished, replaced instantly by Holly's desktop.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "What the hell?" Frost stood up, slapping the table. "Hopkins, we lost video. Wiggle the HDMI cable. It’s loose again."
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The IT Director, Hopkins, was in the corner, frantically tapping at his tablet. He didn't move toward the cable. His face had gone pale.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "It's... it's not the cable, sir," Hopkins stammered. "The display just forced a source switch. It went to Wireless Direct."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "So switch it back!" Jameson barked. "I have slides!"
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "I can't!" Hopkins voice pitched up an octave. "I'm locked out. The panel says <code class="text-uppercase">Admin Override Active</code>. Sir, I don't understand... this command is coming from the Infrastructure Layer. It's pre-empting our entire subnet."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Jameson spun around to stare at Holly. "You're hacking us! Hopkins, cut the Guest Wifi!"
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "She's not <em>on</em> the Wifi!" Hopkins yelled back, forgetting his rank. "I'm looking at the live logs—she doesn't exist! She's bypassing the firewall entirely. It's like the monitor is listening to a ghost!"
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Holly didn't answer. She didn't even look up from her keyboard. She simply let the panic ripple through the room, a terrifying variable that neither the executive nor his tech support could solve.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "It's not your offer," she said calmly, watching the wireless handshake complete. "I deleted your offer."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A new window appeared on the giant screen. It wasn't a spreadsheet. It was an email client.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "We're here because last Tuesday, you decided to bypass our official channels. The only way to reach our company is through <code>inquiries@engineroom-records.com</code>. But you didn't want to talk to the label. You wanted to divide and conquer."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Frost paled. "I... I was simply reaching out to key stakeholders."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "You were reaching out to the men," Holly corrected, her voice dangerously calm. "You looked at our band roster, assumed the guys were in charge, and guessed an email address. You typed <code>tyler.wright@thestardustengine.com</code>."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She pointed at the screen, highlighting the email header.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Tyler's email isn't public. In fact, that specific address doesn't even exist."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Frost squinted at the giant projection screen, his corporate arrogance momentarily replaced by genuine confusion. "If the address doesn't exist... how are you projecting my email on the wall?"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Holly smiled. It was a cold, terrifying expression.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Because Evan handles our network architecture. He configured our mail server so that any message sent to a fabricated alias doesn't just bounce. It gets trapped, flagged as an anomaly, and routed directly to our shared system log: <code>management@thestardustengine.com</code>."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She leaned forward, locking eyes with him.

                        <p>Tyler,</p>
                        <p>I assume whoever handles your general <code>inquiries@</code> inbox is overwhelmed with day-to-day admin work, so I'm reaching out directly. These deals can be complex.</p>
                        <p>Look, I tried to message your band on The Sprawl (@StardustEngine), but whoever runs that account just kept sending me pictures of space? Very confusing branding. You should really tell your social media girl to check her DMs.</p>
                        <p>Anyway, we're ready to make a serious offer. We're talking generational wealth here. I think it's time we get the key players in a room and hash this out—you, me, and Ryan. We can handle the numbers, <strong>let the girls handle the merch.</strong></p>
                        <p>Let me know when you're in LA.</p>
                        <p>- J. Frost</p>

                    <p>
                        The silence in the room was absolute. Even the junior analysts looked horrified.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "That account on The Sprawl?" Holly asked, the temperature in the room dropping. "It belongs to a nineteen-year-old astronomy student in New Zealand. He posts photos of nebulas from his backyard telescope. I haven't issued a cease-and-desist because I happen to like the pictures."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She let the silence hang for a second, letting the sheer weight of his incompetence settle over the mahogany table.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "My band has been touring internationally since 1987. We have sold millions of records. The fact that the Vice President of Acquisitions for a global media conglomerate couldn't tell the difference between a multi-platinum rock band and a teenager's telescope feed is... staggering."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She stood up and walked to the head of the table, pointing to the line in the email about "the girls."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "And this," Holly said, tapping the screen. "Let the girls handle the merch."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She smiled. It wasn't a nice smile.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "You're right, Jameson. 'The girls' <em>do</em> handle the merch. Cassidy designs it. I fulfill it."

                        "I handle the merch because it makes money," she said, leaning in. "Unlike your company."

                    <p>
                        "You see, Jameson, you assumed I was 'overwhelmed' with admin work. You didn't bother to check who you were actually negotiating with, did you?"

                    <p>
                        She tapped a key. The email vanished. Her professional CV appeared on the screen. She looked around the table at the room full of <strong>Gilded League</strong> MBAs and realized something that made her blood run cold: <strong>She was the only qualified person in the room.</strong>

                        Holly started to close her laptop, then stopped. She turned to look at the glass wall of the conference room, overlooking Century City.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "One last thing, Jameson. Nice office. <strong>Pacific Rim Properties</strong> manages this building, correct?"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Frost blinked, confused by the sudden change in topic. "Yes. They are the landlord. We have a standard lease."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Do you know who owns Pacific Rim Properties?"

                    <p>
                        Holly pulled a piece of paper from her folder and slid it across the mahogany table. It wasn't a legal brief. It was a Tenant Ledger.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Pacific Rim is a wholly owned subsidiary of the <strong>O'Connell Family Trust</strong>. I am Pacific Rim."

                        She watched the realization dawn on him. It was slow, painful, and absolutely total.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "You never made the connection, did you?" she said, her voice dropping to a conversational tone. "You saw 'Holly O'Connell' on the band roster and thought 'manager.' You saw 'H. O'Connell' on your rent invoices and thought 'landlord.' It never occurred to you that we might be the same person because your worldview doesn't allow for a band manager to own a skyscraper."

                    <p>
                        "I've never been to this building before today, Jameson. I manage Pacific Rim remotely from Virginia. I let Elena run the day-to-day. But make no mistake: I own the chair you're sitting in. And according to my records, your July and August rent checks bounced."

                        Silence hung in the air for exactly three seconds. Then, Jameson Frost started to laugh.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was a dry, condescending chuckle. He looked at his Junior Counsel, a young man in a tailored suit named Bradford.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "She's bluffing," Frost said, shaking his head. "Bradford, tell her."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bradford cleared his throat, looking nervous but eager to please. "Actually, Ms. O'Connell... under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1161, a verbal Notice to Quit is not legally binding. It must be served in writing, stating the precise amount due, and providing a three-day cure period."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Frost smirked, leaning back in his chair. "See? You can't just declare eviction by saying the word. You're not a magician. You need paperwork, honey."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Holly looked at Bradford. "You're right. Section 1161(2). In writing. Three days to pay or quit."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She reached down to her <strong>pristine leather briefcase</strong>. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Funny you should mention that."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Click. Click.</em>

                    <p>
                        She opened the case. From the front pocket, she pulled a single, crisp sheet of heavy cream-colored linen stock paper. The logo at the top—a stylized column—was embossed in silver foil.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She didn't hand it to Bradford. She slid it across the mahogany table directly to Jameson Frost.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was pure reflex. Jameson reached out and snatched the document before it slid off the edge. He held it up, blinking at the embossed silver logo, his brain struggling to process the heavy, expensive texture of the linen stock. <em>What is this?</em>

                        "I stopped by the Pacific Rim office on our way upstairs," Holly said softly. "Printed on 32lb linen stock. Served to a corporate officer. Witnesses present."

                    <p>
                        Frost looked down at the paper. The laughter died in his throat.

                        "You have seventy-two hours, Jameson," she said, finally snapping her briefcase shut. "Clock started when you touched that paper."

                    <p>
                        Holly reached over and snapped her laptop shut, severing the connection to the giant screen. The room plunged back into silence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "You aren't a savior, Jameson. You're a squatter. You're trying to use our credit score to refinance your bad decisions. And you were arrogant enough to insult the most qualified person in this room."

                    <p>
                        She picked up her notebook, standing up to her full height. She didn't look back at the pale, sweating Vice President who was still staring at his own eviction notice.

                        "Ryan, get Cassidy. We're done here."

                    <p>
                        She walked to the door, pausing only once to look back.

                    <p>
                        "Update your resume, Jameson. And next time... check the org chart."

                        <strong>Evan and Tyler Wright</strong> stood shoulder-to-shoulder, their broad backs forming a physical wall between the conference table and the floor. They didn't look at Frost. They didn't look at the screen. They watched the door, ensuring no one entered or left without permission.

                        Behind that wall, <strong>Ryan O'Connell</strong> had locked the brakes of his wheelchair. He leaned precariously over the side, wrapping his arms around his sister on the floor in a desperate "deep pressure" hold.
