 * Path: /engine-room/artists/stardust-engine/story/nine-figure-refusal/the-counter-offer
 * 
 * CORE RESPONSIBILITY:
 * Renders the narrative partial for "The Counter-Offer" (The "Poison Pill" Letter),
 * integrating a dynamic letterhead component to display Holly's strategic rejection
 * of the Omni-Global acquisition.
 * 
 * LORE CONTEXT (Nine-Figure Refusal Arc):
 * - CHAPTER 2: THE TRAP (Part 3).
 * - Focuses on the "Kill Switch" letter where Holly O'Connell rejects the $150M offer
 *   and triggers the financial collapse of Omni-Global.
 * - Highlights the "Army of One" bluff regarding legal and financial teams.
 * 
 * UI/UX & STYLING ARCHITECTURE:
 * - Utilizes Bootstrap 5 cards, grid system, and utility classes for layout and
 *   narrative pacing.
 * - Integrates Phosphor Icons (`ph ph-envelope-open-text`, `ph ph-circle-info`) for
 *   visual embellishment.
 * - Extensively relies on the modular `letterhead.php` component to simulate a 
 *   physical corporate document.
 * 
 * DEPENDENCIES & INCLUSIONS:
 * - Includes the Corporate Letterhead component (`/includes/components/corporate/letterhead.php`)
 *   which expects variables like `$letter_date`, `$letter_to`, `$brand`, and `$letter_body`.
 * - Includes the Narrative Stepper component (`/includes/components/navigation/narrative-stepper.php`)
 *   for story progression.
 * - Depends on the parent router for the HTML shell.
 * 
 * MAINTENANCE NOTES:
 * - The letter content string (`$letter_body`) contains inline HTML. Maintain valid HTML
 *   within this variable to prevent rendering issues in the letterhead component.
 * - Updates to WCAG compliance and component implementation have been applied.

                <p>Dear Mr. Frost,</p>
                
                <p>We are in receipt of your unsolicited offer to acquire Engine Room Records, LLC for the sum of $150,000,000 (USD).</p>

                <p>After a thorough review of the proposed Purchase Agreement by <strong>our legal and financial teams</strong>, we must <strong>reject</strong> your offer in its entirety. We find the structure of the deal—specifically the Leveraged Buyout provisions outlined in Section 4.a—to be incompatible with the long-term stability of our assets.</p>

                <p>Furthermore, <strong>our due diligence</strong> has uncovered significant irregularities in Omni-Global\'s own balance sheet. Specifically, your "Goodwill" valuation appears to be leveraged against projected earnings that do not exist.</p>

                <h5 class="fw-bold text-uppercase mt-4 mb-3 text-decoration-underline" style="font-family: \'Arial\', sans-serif; font-size: 1rem;">Our Counter-Demand</h5>
                
                <p>To avoid a protracted legal conflict that would require these financial irregularities to become public record, Engine Room Records, LLC proposes the following resolution:</p>

                <ol class="mb-4 fw-bold">
                    <li class="mb-2"><strong>Immediate Withdrawal:</strong> Omni-Global will publicly withdraw its hostile bid by 5:00 PM EST today.</li>
                    <li class="mb-2"><strong>Non-Compete:</strong> Omni-Global will agree to a 10-year moratorium on any future attempts to acquire Engine Room Records or its subsidiaries.</li>
                    <li><strong>Termination Fee:</strong> Omni-Global will pay a symbolic termination fee of <strong>$1.00</strong> to close this matter.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>If these terms are not met by the deadline, we will consider this a hostile action. As fiduciaries, we will be legally obligated to report our findings regarding your insolvency to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to protect our own credit rating.</p>

                <p>We await your prompt confirmation.</p>
