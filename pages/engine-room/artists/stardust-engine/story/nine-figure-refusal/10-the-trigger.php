 * 
 * CORE RESPONSIBILITY:
 * Renders the climactic "Slide 14" narrative partial detailing the specific inciting
 * incident that terminated the acquisition deal. Features a heavily styled pseudo-slide
 * and dramatic visual breakdown of the ensuing conflict.
 * 
 * LORE CONTEXT (Nine-Figure Refusal Arc):
 * - The Event That Started The War: Slide 14 & The Fallout.
 * - Context: The specific moment the deal died due to the corporate dissection of 'Ad Astra'.
 * - Visualizes "Slide 14" and the profound violation of Cassidy O'Connell's core identity.
 * 
 * UI/UX & STYLING ARCHITECTURE:
 * - Employs custom CSS (`.slide-container`, `.slide-header`, `.slide-watermark`) to
 *   skeuomorphically render a corporate PowerPoint slide within the webpage.
 * - Includes dark mode adaptations (`[data-bs-theme="dark"] .slide-container`) to ensure
 *   the slide deliberately remains jarringly bright against dark interfaces.
 * - Relies on Bootstrap 5 utility classes for grid layouts, typography, and spacing.
 * - Utilizes Phosphor Icons (`ph ph-bolt`, `ph ph-heart-crack`, `ph ph-shield-halved`) for
 *   visual emphasis.
 * 
 * DEPENDENCIES & INCLUSIONS:
 * - Depends on a parent layout or router for the HTML document shell and `$cdnBaseUrl`.
 * - Includes the Narrative Stepper component (`/includes/components/navigation/narrative-stepper.php`)
 *   for inter-story navigation.
 * 
 * MAINTENANCE NOTES:
 * - Do not alter the custom inline styles or hardcoded lore text without consulting the
 *   broader "Nine-Figure Refusal" narrative outline.
 * - Ensure the `$nav` array URLs correctly align with the router's expectations for
 *   this lore sequence.

                        At 10:14 AM, Jameson Frost clicked the remote. The screen flickered.

                    <p class="text-body-secondary">
                        Up until this moment, the meeting had been tense but professional. Frost had insulted their business model, their "lack of debt," and their touring logistics. The family had endured it all with stoic amusement.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-body-secondary">
                        Then <strong>Slide 14</strong> appeared.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-body-secondary">
                        Frost smiled. "We call this the 'Diamond in the Rough.' You have a track called <em>Escape Velocity</em>. Great vocals. Catchy hook. But it's fifteen minutes long. It's unlistenable. It's un-monetizable."
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-body-secondary">
                        He pressed a button. A speaker on the conference table crackled to life.

                        It played a 30-second loop. Omni-Global producers had taken Cassidy's voice, stripped away the music, and layered it over a generic car-commercial beat. They had cut Ryan's guitar solo entirely.
