                <p>To the Crew,</p>
                
                <p>By now, you have been notified by the Bankruptcy Trustee that your employment with Omni-Global Media has been terminated. You have also likely discovered that your last two paychecks have bounced. I am sorry. You deserved better leaders.</p>

                <p>However, while the corporation is dead, the work you did was real. You know how to run this building. You know the logistics. You know the clients. <strong>You are not the problem. You are the infrastructure.</strong></p>

                <p>Engine Room Records has signed a long-term lease for Floors 38, 39, and 40. We are establishing a new West Coast headquarters: <strong>The Jessica Miller Center</strong>.</p>

                <p>We are not bringing in a new team. We want you.</p>

                    <li class="mb-3"><strong>Paid Renovation Leave:</strong> We are gutting the executive floor to remove the... toxicity. Construction will take 6 weeks. During this time, you are on <strong>Full Paid Furlough</strong>. Go home. Rest. Spend the holidays with your families.</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>One Condition:</strong> The culture changes today. We do not yell. We do not demand overtime without consent. And we do not look down on anyone. If you liked the old way, do not sign this letter.</p>

                <p>For everyone else: Welcome to the Engine Room.</p>
