While waiting, the band huddled around a rolling TV cart playing a VHS of <em>Toon Brigade Against Trouble</em> just to pass the time.

Seeing the frontman in a wheelchair shattered his manufactured vision instantly, but the true catastrophe was still to come when Vance demanded they set up for "Shot 12."

                    Superstar <strong>Cydele</strong> was dominating the global conversation with a highly controversial, explicit multimedia project. Apex Records, terrified of losing market share, wanted to compete.

                    <strong>Friction</strong> was canceled immediately following the altercation. Armed with the threat of exposing Vance's negligence and exploitation, Holly O'Connell forced Apex Records to void their contract. The band was free. Holly founded <strong>Engine Room Records</strong>, and the band, fueled by the trauma and rage, retreated to their Blacksburg warehouse to record their true debut: 1995's legendary <strong>The Warehouse Tapes.</strong>
