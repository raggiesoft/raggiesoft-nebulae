 * ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW:
 * This view implements a client-side content gate ("Content Warning") before
 * revealing the narrative regarding the redacted lyrics of "Friction."
 *
 * MAINTENANCE NOTES:
 * - Employs JSON-LD Article schema for metadata.
 * - Uses inline JavaScript (`unlockContent()`) to toggle visibility of the
 *   `#content-gate` and `#restricted-content` divs. Do not remove these IDs.
 * - Visual redactions are achieved using standard HTML and CSS (`.redaction-bar`).
 * - Employs dark mode overrides in the local `<style>` block.

                        <p>
                            In 1992, Cydele's multimedia controversies were rewriting the rules of the music industry. "Shock value" was the ultimate currency, and Apex Records demanded a piece of the market share. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When executive Julian Vance took over The Stardust Engine's sophomore project, he didn't care about their science-fiction concepts or the thermal dynamics of atmospheric re-entry. Vance saw a young, attractive male and female lead. He looked at their 1989 promotional photos—taken long before Ryan’s paralysis—and made a series of depraved calculations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Vance and his ghostwriters completely hijacked the title track. They stripped out the band's intended sci-fi themes and produced a finalized lyrics sheet for <em>"Friction"</em> that was engineered for maximum, horrifying controversy.

                        <p>
                            The band <em>did</em> see this lyrics sheet. Julian Vance handed it directly to them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The lyrics were not subtle. They were explicitly, deliberately written in a way that would make the listener believe Ryan and Cassidy were engaged in a sexual relationship. When Vance drafted this campaign, he operated under the ignorant, fatal assumption that the two attractive leads were a married couple. He had no idea they were biological siblings. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, the sheer depravity of handing this explicitly romantic and sexualized lyrics sheet to a brother and sister—and subsequently trying to force them to execute his vision on camera during "Shot 12" even after the truth was laid bare—crossed a line from which there was no return.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="text-danger fw-bold text-uppercase mt-5 mb-4 border-bottom border-danger-subtle pb-2">The Permanent Redaction</h3>
                        <p>
                            The realization of what Vance was demanding culminated in the catastrophic warehouse photo shoot, ending with Ryan's roaring defense of his sister and Holly O'Connell severing the contract entirely.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Because the lyrics to "Friction" were engineered as an act of profound psychological violence and exploitation against the siblings, Engine Room Records established an absolute, zero-tolerance protocol regarding the track.

The song died the day the band walked out of that warehouse, ensuring Vance's depravity would never define their legacy.
