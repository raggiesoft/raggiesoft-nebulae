 * 
 * CORE RESPONSIBILITY:
 * Renders the lore overview page for "The Cosmic Tidal Lock Sound&trade;" and "80s Cosmic Pop."
 * This page acts as both in-universe narrative documentation and practical meta-instructions 
 * (Suno AI Engineering Guide) for synthesizing the band's specific audio profile.
 * 
 * LORE CONTEXT:
 * - Details the distinction between the genre (80s Cosmic Pop) and the proprietary 
 *   trademarked engineering technique developed by Cassidy O'Connell.
 * - Outlines the legal strategy used by Engine Room Records to protect the sound.
 * - Includes the lyrics and narrative breakdown of the catalyst track "Moon 1 (Tidal Lock)."
 * 
 * UI/UX & STYLING ARCHITECTURE:
 * - Utilizes a custom starfield background (`.starfield-container`, `.starfield-twinkling`) 
 *   for cosmic immersion.
 * - Implements a "glassmorphism" design aesthetic using custom classes (`.glass-container`, 
 *   `.glass-card`) combined with Bootstrap 5 utilities.
 * - Uses structured JSON-LD (`@type: Article`) for SEO and rich snippets.
 * - Relies heavily on Phosphor Icons for thematic visual cues.
 * 
 * DEPENDENCIES & INCLUSIONS:
 * - Requires a parent routing layer to provide the document shell and base Bootstrap assets.
 * - Assumes the existence of global CSS for the `starfield-*` and `glass-*` classes.
 * 
 * MAINTENANCE NOTES:
 * - The `Suno Engineering Guide` section contains exact prompt engineering strings. Do not
 *   alter these prompts without testing the output generation profile.
 * - The `$articleSchema` array must be kept in sync with the page content to ensure
 *   accurate structured data.

                            This sound is exactly what the band <em>wanted</em> to do in 1987. However, Apex Records flatly refused, demanding safe, terrestrial dance-pop instead.

                        <p class="text-white-75 small mb-0">
                            The distinct engineering technique was born out of absolute necessity following the 1992 "Friction Catastrophe." It was first fully realized and perfected by Cassidy on the track <strong>"Moon 1 (Tidal Lock)"</strong>. Because the sound is 100% Cassidy's vision and execution, tracks utilizing this specific profile feature her crystal-clear female vocals exclusively.

                            Through the independent boutique label she founded in 1992—Engine Room Records—Holly aggressively established common law rights to <em>The Cosmic Tidal Lock Sound&trade;</em>. This gave the band impenetrable legal ammunition. If another studio or corporate entity attempts to rip off their exact production style in a commercial or pop track, Holly has the documentation and the priority of use to shut them down immediately.

                            This track is unabashedly Cassidy’s favorite song on the album. It is a brilliant execution of pure, driving 1980s synth-pop, but transposed entirely into the deep cosmos. Had Apex Records allowed them to write music this imaginative in 1987, this would have easily been the lead single on their debut. Lyrically, it uses the astrophysical concept of a "tidal lock"—where a moon is gravitationally bound to always show the exact same face to its planet—as a gorgeous metaphor for unwavering loyalty. It also features a clever lyrical callback to the "anchor" motif from Disc 1, proving that their terrestrial past and their cosmic future are completely aligned.

                                    The telemetry is clear tonight<br>
                                    Half in the shadow, half in the light<br>
                                    I'm caught in the orbit, spinning around<br>
                                    A million miles above the ground
