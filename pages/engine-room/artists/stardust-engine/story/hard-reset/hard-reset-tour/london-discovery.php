 * ARCHITECTURAL OVERVIEW:
 * This lore page documents "The London Discovery" of the band 'Origin'. It uses a standard
 * Bootstrap card-based layout to segment the narrative elements (The Wake, The Call, The Approach).
 * 
 * Future Maintenance Notes:
 * - Ensure this page remains linked to the overarching timeline. It bridges the Hard Reset 
 *   era with the later inclusion of 'Origin' to the label.
 * - The 'transform-rotate-1' custom class and 'Caveat' handwriting font are used 
 *   to style "The Napkin Deal" visually as a handwritten document.

                        It was sheer chance. Ryan O'Connell and Evan Wright had ducked into the basement club just to escape the London rain.
