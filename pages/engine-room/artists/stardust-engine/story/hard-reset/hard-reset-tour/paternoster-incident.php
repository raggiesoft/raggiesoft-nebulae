/**
 * ARCHITECTURAL OVERVIEW:
 * This lore page details the accessibility nightmare the band faced during the 1998 
 * European tour, specifically the "Paternoster Incident". It heavily relies on danger/warning 
 * alerts and high-contrast components to emphasize the hazards and stress of the tour.
 * 
 * Future Maintenance Notes:
 * - The page includes specific details about "Clause 12 (Accommodation)" which ties into
 *   the band's logistical lore. Maintain these continuity threads.
 * - Ensure WCAG compliance claims in the header remain valid when modifying structure.

                        The lobby was dominated by a <strong>Paternoster</strong>—a cyclic elevator with no doors, just a chain of open wooden boxes moving relentlessly upward. <em>Click-clack. Click-clack.</em> You had to hop on while it was moving.

                        The locals joked that if you missed your floor and rode the box "over the top," the gears would grind you to dust. While technically a myth (the car just loops safely over the top), to a man paralyzed from the waist down trapped in a metal frame, the threat felt terrifyingly real.

                There was no other elevator. The interview was on the 6th floor.

                Without a word, <strong>Tyler Wright</strong> handed his backpack to Holly. He grabbed the back handles of Ryan's chair. <strong>Evan Wright</strong> grabbed the front frame by the knees. They didn't ask for help. They simply tilted Ryan back forty-five degrees and began the climb up six flights of marble stairs.
            </p>
            <p class="text-body-secondary mb-5">
                Ryan did the interview sweating, still covered in the dust of the stairwell. When the journalist asked about his "glamorous rock star life," Ryan just laughed.

                        European hotel rooms were tiny. "Accessible" usually just meant the door was slightly wider. For the O'Connell siblings, this posed a logistical crisis. Privacy had died on I-81 in 1990. Ryan's care—intermittent catheterization, bowel management, skin checks—required assistance that only <strong>Cassidy</strong> and <strong>Holly</strong> were trusted to provide.

                            It became an autistic need for both Ryan and Cassidy—the sensory grounding of the "puppy pile." Ryan in the middle (where it was easiest to turn him), Cassidy on his left (her "Safe Side"), Holly on the right (closest to the medical bag). They slept tangled together, a protective knot of limbs that kept the world out and the "Engine" safe.
