 * ARCHITECTURE & ENGINEERING BLOCK
 * Component: Fractured Prisms - 1985 American Shores Tour Archive
 * Theme: "Prism Dark" / Archival Document
 * 
 * 1. COMPONENT PURPOSE:
 *    - Renders a highly specific narrative document detailing the band's live performance protocols.
 *    - Styled as a confidential, watermarked manifesto.
 * 
 * 2. DESIGN & STYLING:
 *    - Uses `artifact-paper` and `artifact-watermark` classes to simulate a leaked internal document.
 *    - Dark mode support relies on CSS variable overrides and specific `data-bs-theme="dark"` styling for the watermark.
 * 
 * 3. TECHNICAL & INTEGRATION NOTES:
 *    - Purely structural HTML/CSS presentation; no dynamic data loading required.
 * 
 * 4. FUTURE MAINTENANCE:
 *    - Ensure any structural changes to the text maintain the `position: relative; z-index: 1;` properties to ensure text appears above the watermark.

                        Backed by immense generational wealth, Fractured Prisms completely bypassed the traditional club circuit. Their first-ever live performance was a sold-out stadium show with no opening act. To execute this while protecting Claire's autistic sensory needs and honouring their deceased siblings, Rhys engineered one of the most uncompromising, heavily restricted stage environments in rock history.
                    </p>

                    <div style="position: relative; z-index: 1;">
                        <h4 class="fw-bold text-uppercase mb-3" style="color: var(--prism-artifact-color, #111); font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">1. The Stage Geometry & "The Session Ghosts"</h4>
                        <p class="small mb-4" style="color: var(--prism-artifact-muted, #333);">
                            The stage is sharply divided into two distinct zones, enforced by physical industrial red tape lines on the floor. <br><br>
                            <strong>The Vanguard:</strong> Rhys and his imposing fortress of mechanical synthesisers, alongside Claire, seated in her wheelchair at the centre of the stage.<br>
                            <strong>The Session Ghosts:</strong> The hired backing band. Positioned strictly in the shadows behind the red tape. They are compensated at the absolute top tier of the industry, but they are "ghosts"—they do not interact with the crowd, they do not cross the red line, and they are never fully illuminated.
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="fw-bold text-uppercase mb-3" style="color: var(--prism-artifact-color, #111); font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">2. Rule Number 1: The Sacred Perimeter</h4>
                        <p class="small mb-4" style="color: var(--prism-artifact-muted, #333);">
                            The family’s original acoustic and electronic instruments are not tools; they are headstones and memorials to the deceased family members. <br><br>
                            <strong>Zero Exceptions:</strong> NO ONE but Rhys or Claire may touch the family's original instruments.<br>
                            <strong>Gwen's Flute:</strong> The most sacred artifact on the tour is Gwen's wooden flute. Claire is its sole custodian. <br>
                            <strong>The Consequence:</strong> If any stagehand, tech, or session player touches the original instruments or bumps the flute stand, it is a "Fired on the Spot" offence.
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="fw-bold text-uppercase mb-3" style="color: var(--prism-artifact-color, #111); font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">3. Acoustic Rigidity & Stage Accommodations</h4>
                        <p class="small mb-4" style="color: var(--prism-artifact-muted, #333);">
                            Because of Claire's autistic needs, the sensory environment must be absolutely predictable.<br><br>
                            <strong>Play the Ink:</strong> The "Session Ghosts" are strictly briefed to play the music exactly as written and rehearsed. There are no unapproved jam sessions, no improvised solos, and no sudden deviations.<br>
                            <strong>The "Hold the Line" Contingency:</strong> If the stadium environment becomes overwhelming, Rhys triggers a specific, repeating synthesiser drone. The band immediately fades to silence, the lights drop to a static blue wash, and everyone holds the line until Rhys gives the visual cue that Claire has recalibrated.
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="fw-bold text-uppercase mb-3" style="color: var(--prism-artifact-color, #111); font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">4. The Sanctum Protocol</h4>
                        <p class="small mb-4" style="color: var(--prism-artifact-muted, #333);">
                            The dressing room and immediate backstage corridor are classified as "The Sanctum." Rhys violently rejects the chaotic VIP rockstar culture to build a fortress around his sister.<br><br>
                            <strong>The "Rhys Only" Directive:</strong> No venue staff or crew members are permitted to assist Claire. Rhys exclusively handles all wheelchair transfers and physical assistance.<br>
                            <strong>Recalibration:</strong> Claire relies entirely on deep pressure hugs from Rhys to stave off sensory meltdowns. If she is overwhelmed, venue staff are instructed to turn away, secure the perimeter, and give the siblings absolute privacy.
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="fw-bold text-uppercase mb-3" style="color: var(--prism-artifact-color, #111); font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">5. The Extraction Protocol</h4>
                        <p class="small mb-0" style="color: var(--prism-artifact-muted, #333);">
                            The lack of wheelchair accessibility in the city's municipal subway, the post-concert mob of 90,000 screaming fans, and the risk to Gwen's flute make standard transport impossible.<br><br>
                            <strong>The Armoured Coach:</strong> A custom-outfitted, heavily armoured, soundproofed conversion van waits deep in the concrete tunnels under the stadium, featuring dim amber lighting and a flat ramp deployment to mimic the sensory safety of a train carriage.<br>
                            <strong>The Route Home:</strong> Their private transport takes a secured, police-escorted route out of the complex, hitting the interstate corridor to begin the quiet journey back to their 1960s ranch house sanctuary in Williamsport, Maryland.

The 90,000-seat stadium instantly drops into a pin-drop, reverent silence, acknowledging the profound memorial weight of the song. Claire joins him, and the siblings trade lines in the dark.</li>
                        <li><strong class="text-primary">5:24 [The Secure Decay]:</strong> Final note. Complete stage blackout. House lights do not come up until Claire has securely returned Gwen's flute to its reinforced case.</li>
