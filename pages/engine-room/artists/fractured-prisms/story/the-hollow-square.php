 * 
 * 1. COMPONENT PURPOSE:
 *    - Renders the deep-lore explainer page for "The Hollow Square".
 *    - Breaks down the three distinct realities of the band's core narrative.
 * 
 * 2. DESIGN & STYLING:
 *    - Implements specific overrides for `gothic-font`, `text-glow-prism`, and `polaroid-prism`.
 *    - Uses a dark UI with subtle purple/lavender accents (`border-prism`).
 *    - "Artifact Paper" styling for archival documents to mimic physical paper.
 * 
 * 3. TECHNICAL & INTEGRATION NOTES:
 *    - This page is heavily text-based and styled inline to ensure standalone integrity of the lore component.
 * 
 * 4. FUTURE MAINTENANCE:
 *    - If new lore sections are added, wrap them in `.lore-card` or `.artifact-paper` components to maintain narrative immersion.

                                To understand <em>Fractured Prisms</em>, you must understand that "The Hollow Square" is not a single place. It is an architectural concept that exists across three distinct layers of reality, serving as both a sanctuary and a memorial for the Manning family.

                        The Transatlantic Escape (1982)
                    </h3>
                    <p class="text-white-75">
                        Before the fracture, the Manning family resided in <strong>Romford</strong>, a historic East London suburb with direct commuter rail access to the city center—the source of Rhys and Claire's light Cockney accents. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white-75">
                        By 1982, the sprawling six-piece family orchestra was gone. Four members had passed away in the tragic 1981 Shap Fell disaster, leaving a devastating void. Claire, then 21, was autistic and living with severe cerebral palsy. She required a wheelchair for mobility and relied on full-time assistance for the most intimate activities of daily living, including bathing, dressing, and toileting. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white-75">
                        In a desperate bid for normalcy, Claire had moved in with a man named Martin, believing she had found a safe harbour and a true marriage. But when the reality of her vows set in, Martin outright refused to assist with her physical caretaking. That refusal broke the illusion, prompting Claire to pack her bags. By sheer coincidence, on the very morning Rhys arrived to bring her home, a TV Licence Enquiry Officer knocked on the door, exposing another of Martin's corner-cutting lies—a quiet confirmation that she was making the right choice.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white-75">
                        It wasn't until weeks later, safely back with Rhys, that the ultimate betrayal was uncovered. Preparing for a brutal, drawn-out legal battle, Claire instructed a solicitor to initiate divorce proceedings, fully expecting them to eventually brief a barrister for the courtroom. But when the solicitor began the preliminary research, they made a staggering discovery: Martin had cheaped out on the officiant and the paperwork. There would be no divorce, because they had never been legally married in the first place.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white-75 mb-0">
                        She turned to the only person who had never viewed her existence as a liability: her 19-year-old younger brother, <strong>Rhys</strong>. Rhys had anchored Claire her entire life. To him, her care wasn't a tragedy; it was just Tuesday. Utilizing their remaining generational wealth and their dual citizenship, the two siblings bypassed immigration red tape, paid cash for their father's vacant childhood home in Williamsport, Maryland, and fled across the Atlantic to start over.

                            Rhys organises the synthesiser cables like a mathematician, trying to rationalise the silence Alistair left behind. He builds these towering, mechanical rhythms, pretending the machines can replicate a pulse. But the synthesiser is cold. It has no flavour, no heartbeat of its own.

                                In the 1883 album art, Claire is depicted standing—whole, unbroken, and fiercely protective. But in the 1983 reality, she was trapped in a body that fought her and a mind haunted by night terrors.

                            <p class="text-white-50 small mb-0">
                                Because she was terrified of the things that went bump in the night, Claire and Rhys shared a bed. This wasn't a quirk; it was a critical grounding mechanism. Even in the 1883 fantasy where she could walk, she still required Rhys's physical proximity to anchor her nervous system to the earth while she slept.

                                To keep their memory alive, Rhys and Claire strictly refused to hire session musicians. Taught by the necessity of their isolation, the two siblings learned to play every single instrument on the album themselves. If you hear a cello, a drum fill, or a guitar solo on a Fractured Prisms track, you are hearing Claire or Rhys desperately trying to fill the silence left by the people they lost.
