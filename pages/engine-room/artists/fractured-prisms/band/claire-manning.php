/**
 * FRACTURED PRISMS BAND: CLAIRE MANNING (LORE PROFILE)
 * 
 * ARCHITECTURAL CONTEXT:
 * This file presents the in-universe character profile ("Resident Profile") for 
 * Claire Manning, a member of the band Fractured Prisms.
 *
 * KEY FEATURES:
 * - Gothic Theming: Implements the overarching `bg-prism-dark` and `text-glow-prism`
 *   styles to maintain the band's specific sub-brand within the label site.
 * - Semantic UI: Utilizes Bootstrap grids, pills/badges, and Phosphor icons
 *   (`ph-microphone-stand`) to organize character data clearly.
 * - Typography: Blends `gothic-font` for headers with `font-monospace` for subtitles,
 *   creating an "archival/dossier" aesthetic.
 *
 * MAINTENANCE NOTES:
 * - Ensure custom CSS classes (`text-glow-prism`, `gothic-font`) remain defined in
 *   the global or band-specific stylesheets.
 * - Profile updates should maintain the established HTML structure to preserve the
 *   dossier aesthetic.

                            </h2>
                            <p class="text-secondary fs-5" style="line-height: 1.8;">
                                In the 1883 psychological sanctuary of The Hollow Square, Claire is whole, unbroken, and fiercely protective of her siblings. In the physical reality of 1983, she was a twenty-two-year-old autistic woman navigating severe cerebral palsy from the seat of a manual wheelchair.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-secondary fs-5" style="line-height: 1.8;">
                                Her physical limitations dictated the very sound of <em>Fractured Prisms</em>. Because complex, rapid instrumentation was impossible for her hands, she became the band's voice. Her vocal deliveries are often described as hauntingly detached, cutting through Rhys's dense synthesizer programming with a chilling, emotional clarity. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-secondary fs-5 mb-0" style="line-height: 1.8;">
                                But it is her work on the wooden flute—the instrument that originally belonged to her late sister, Gwen—that defines the band's acoustic soul. Claire taught herself to play it purely out of a desperate need to keep Gwen's memory alive, breathing humanity back into the cold, mechanical rhythms her brother built.

                    The Exit Strategy (1982)
                </h3>
                <p class="text-secondary mb-4 fs-5">
                    Before fleeing to Maryland, Claire briefly attempted to find normalcy in a disastrous marriage. Her husband was a penny-pinching, emotionally neglectful man who quickly realized he had no interest in assisting with her daily physical care. Recognizing the trap she was in, Claire quietly orchestrated her escape, calling her younger brother Rhys to collect her and her wheelchair. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-secondary mb-5 fs-5">
                    Her departure perfectly coincided with a knock at the door that would become a legendary piece of family lore.

                    <div class="fs-5" style="line-height: 1.8;">
                        <p>
                            The knock at the door was sharp, loud, and carried the distinct, heavy rhythm of bureaucratic authority.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Claire manually wheeled herself forward, her arms aching from the effort of packing, but her resolve absolute. She pulled the door open, fully expecting it to be a neighbour, or perhaps the postman dropping off a parcel before Rhys arrived.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Instead, she found a weary-looking man standing on the front step. He was wearing a drab mackintosh and clutching a heavy clipboard against his chest like a shield. He had the braced, defensive posture of a man who spent his entire professional life waiting to be shouted at.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            "Good afternoon, madam," he said, his tone stiff and legally rehearsed. "I am an Enquiry Officer for the Television Licensing Authority."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Claire stopped listening to his exact words as the glorious reality of the situation washed over her. The TV man. He wasn't just a tax collector; he represented the single most universally despised group of bureaucrats in all of Britain. And he was standing on this doorstep. Looking for <em>him</em>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Her mind rapidly connected the dots. The shiny new twenty-two-inch cathode-ray tube currently blaring a vibrant, full-colour broadcast of The Albion Broadcast News in the sitting room. Her husband’s obsessive, paranoid insistence on keeping the heavy front curtains tightly drawn all week. His constant, penny-pinching complaints about household expenses.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He bought the fifteen-pound paper. He actually lied to the Post Office to save thirty quid, and the absolute idiot got caught. A slow, radiant smile erupted across Claire's face. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            She had spent the entire morning dealing with the heavy, exhausting reality of abandoning a failed marriage. But this? This was a parting gift from the universe itself. She was already walking out the door, and right on cue, Her Majesty’s Government had arrived to completely ruin his week. It was almost poetic.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Enquiry Officer faltered. He was entirely unnerved by her beaming expression. He had braced for a screaming match.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            "...I can hear a broadcast," the officer stammered, checking his clipboard, "and I must warn you that installing or using a colour television receiver without the appropriate licence is a criminal offence under the Wireless Telegraphy Act. I must formally request your permission to enter the premises to inspect—"
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            "Oh, you don't need to warn me," Claire interrupted, her smile widening into something brilliantly vindictive as she pulled the door wide open. "And you definitely need to come inside. Let me show you exactly what he bought."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The officer stepped into the sitting room, visibly disoriented by the utter lack of hostility. He was a man accustomed to vicious dogs and slammed doors; instead, he was being treated as the home's most honoured guest. Claire wheeled herself to the kitchenette, returning with a freshly brewed pot of tea and a plate of Custard Creams. As the officer settled onto the sofa, she began systematically dismantling her husband's life with cheerful, bureaucratic precision.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            First, she produced a letter from the Department of Health and Social Security. "You'll note the address on my medical allowance," she said, tapping the paper. "I am technically just a visitor here. My permanent residence is with my brother across town."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Second, she opened a drawer and retrieved the original retailer's receipt, complete with her husband's signature and the colour television's exact model number. The smoking gun.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally, she placed the heavy, clunky remote control right next to his teacup. "Feel free to check the colour saturation yourself, Officer."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When Rhys arrived thirty minutes later, the first thing he did was cross the sitting room and wrap his sister in a tight, sustained embrace. It was a deep-pressure therapeutic hug—a mandatory, grounding ritual between the siblings that helped regulate Claire's autism. Only after he felt the tension of the morning finally leave her shoulders did he turn to acknowledge the Television Licensing Authority sitting comfortably on the sofa.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Rhys nodded politely to the official. Anticipating the bureaucracy, he smoothly produced his own driver's licence, proving he resided on the other side of town and was simply here to collect his sister and bring her home. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While the officer continued his paperwork, Rhys loaded the last of Claire's packed boxes into his car. He accepted a quick cup of tea, standing by the door as Claire delivered her final stroke of vengeance.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            "He gets off the commuter rail at exactly 5:25," Claire informed the officer brightly. "If you wait right there, he’ll be walking through that door in forty-five minutes."
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-0 fst-italic mt-4 text-center">
                            With the trap perfectly set, Rhys wheeled Claire out the front door and down the path. He carefully helped her transfer into the passenger seat of his car before folding the heavy manual wheelchair and stowing it in the boot. They drove away, leaving the officer to finish his paperwork in peace. The dregs in the teapot were left to go stone cold for her husband's return.
