 * ============================================================================
 * ARCHITECTURE & ENGINEERING BLOCK
 * Component: Fractured Prisms - Carnaby Street (1983) Discography Page
 * Theme: "Prism Dark" (Gothic/Synthwave Hybrid)
 * 
 * 1. COMPONENT PURPOSE:
 *    - Renders the discography detail page for the album "Carnaby Street".
 *    - Integrates with the `_album-art-header.php` component for standardized header styling.
 *    - Dynamically loads tracklist data via `_tracklist-downloader.php`.
 * 
 * 2. DESIGN & STYLING:
 *    - Uses a dark, gothic-inspired theme (`bg-prism-dark`, `text-glow-prism`).
 *    - Polaroid styling for archival imagery to emphasize the 1980s setting.
 * 
 * 3. TECHNICAL & INTEGRATION NOTES:
 *    - Relies on global `$cdnBaseUrl` for loading images.
 *    - `$album_path_web` dictates the data source path for the tracklist downloader.
 * 
 * 4. FUTURE MAINTENANCE:
 *    - To change the tracklist, update the JSON file in the corresponding `$album_path_web` directory, rather than editing this PHP file.

                The 1983 Debut Album
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                The masterpiece that defined an era. Blending atmospheric progressive rock with sharp, melodic pop sensibilities, this 1983 release cemented Fractured Prisms as architects of the modern rock landscape.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-3">
                Following the 1981 Shap Fell disaster that claimed the lives of four family members, Rhys and Claire Manning retreated to a heavily modified, soundproofed ranch house in Williamsport, Maryland. Refusing to hire session musicians, the two siblings sequenced sprawling progressive rock arrangements entirely on analog synthesizers and early drum machines to fill the silence left by their orchestra.

                <strong class="text-primary" style="font-family: var(--font-gothic); letter-spacing: 1px;">A TRIBUTE TO THE MISSING FOUR:</strong><br>
                Originally intended to be a self-titled record, the siblings renamed it <em>Carnaby Street</em> as a heartbreaking homage. It commemorates the final, perfect day the six family members spent together shopping for records in Soho, just twenty-four hours before a massive pile-up on the desolate, fog-choked Shap Fell stretch of the M6 motorway instantly claimed the lives of the four eldest siblings.

                        Because <em>Carnaby Street</em> was technically produced, mixed, and mastered across a hybrid corporate structure (Rhys's logistics company in Delaware and the physical studio in Maryland), the album's massive commercial success inadvertently created a financial disaster. The complex, multi-state royalty distribution bypassed standard band accounting, accidentally triggering a massive, unexpected IRS tax bill for the isolated, grieving siblings.

                    There are no hired session musicians on <em>Carnaby Street</em>. When a traditional instrument cuts through the icy synthesisers, it is a holy relic pulled from the 1981 wreckage. When the piercing, organic breath of the flute anchors tracks like "Mirrors of Yesterday," it is Claire physically holding and playing her deceased cousin's wooden flute to keep her "Safe Harbor" melody alive in the room.
