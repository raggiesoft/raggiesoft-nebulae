 * Architecture & Maintenance Notes:
 * - Employs `_album-art-header.php` for standardized hero imagery.
 * - Employs `_tracklist-downloader.php` to dynamically render the tracklist 
 *   from central JSON, automatically handling the 2-disc layout based on data.
 * - Studio archives section uses .lore-card and .artifact-paper styling.

                Following the massive, unexpected commercial success of <em>Carnaby Street</em>, Rhys and Claire Manning retreated entirely from the public eye. Instead of touring, they locked the doors of their Maryland studio and plunged into their shared hyper-fixation: Victorian London. In this narrative reality, the Shap Fell disaster never happened. The family is whole, and Claire is unburdened by her physical paralysis. It is a beautiful, haunting delusion pressed onto two discs of vinyl.

                        Despite the sweeping, orchestral sound of the album, there are zero hired session musicians credited on the liner notes. <em>1883</em> was recorded entirely in isolation by the two siblings. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text small mb-0">
                        In a production style mirroring Phil Collins' <em>Both Sides</em>, Rhys and Claire physically played every single instrument on the record. If the arrangement called for strings, brass, or complex percussion, the siblings picked up the surviving instruments of their deceased family members and learned how to play them. The album is quite literally a séance performed through analog tape.

                    The vibrant colors of the 1983 debut were stripped away for this release. The band's logo, the album art, and all promotional materials were rendered in stark, Victorian monochrome. The cover art depicts Claire standing upright, holding Gwen's flute, staring down a fog-covered London street. It is a visual representation of the psychological "Safe Harbor" she built in her mind—a world defined by order, classical beauty, and the physical autonomy she was denied in the real world.
