                The 2002 Debut Album
            </p>
            <p class="lead text-secondary">
                Recorded entirely in the heavily modified, sound-dampened Garage Studio of the Kids House, <em>Crimson Node</em> is the self-titled debut album of the family's collaborative 1980s pop/rock project.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted">
                Driven by heavy MIDI synth bass lines, artillery-strike drumming, and clinical rhythm guitar, the album introduces the band's signature "Rotating Vocalist" protocol. Managed and produced entirely by Matt Miller from his central wheelchair-accessible command station, this record bridges the chaotic precision of Albemarle County with the heavy, industrial legacy of Engine Room Records.

                            Engineered in the Kids House attached garage, the space was entirely repurposed from vehicle storage into a sound-dampened rehearsal room. Matt oversaw all audio production from his custom Vanguard LogicPad rig, utilizing a strict "Rotating Vocalist" protocol for his sister and cousins to seamlessly trade off lead duties depending on the track's required energy.

                            Discovered by <a href="/engine-room/artists/stardust-engine/band/ryan-oconnell">Ryan O'Connell</a> during a Commonwealth Polytechnic Institute (CPI) open house, the burned CD-R demo tape was passed to Engine Room Records CEO Holly O'Connell. Recognizing a shared ethos of independence, fierce family loyalty, and blue-collar musical integrity, the label officially signed <em>Crimson Node</em> to their Blacksburg-based roster.
