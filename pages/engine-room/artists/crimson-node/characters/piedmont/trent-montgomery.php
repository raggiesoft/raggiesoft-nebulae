/**
 * CRIMSON NODE LORE: TRENT MONTGOMERY
 * 
 * ARCHITECTURAL CONTEXT:
 * This file serves as the character dossier for "Trent Montgomery" within the 
 * "University of the Piedmont" faction of the Crimson Node story universe.
 *
 * KEY FEATURES:
 * - Breadcrumb Navigation: Implements a hierarchical Bootstrap breadcrumb to 
 *   anchor the character within the larger "Crimson Node / Piedmont" structure.
 * - Flexbox Layout: Uses responsive Bootstrap flex utilities (`d-flex flex-column flex-md-row`)
 *   to cleanly align the character thumbnail and metadata headers.
 * - Thematic Coloring: Utilizes `text-danger` for links, reinforcing the "Crimson" aesthetic.
 *
 * MAINTENANCE NOTES:
 * - Ensure `$cdnBaseUrl` is defined in the global context before this page is rendered.
 * - If the character's faction or location changes in the lore, the breadcrumb 
 *   structure must be manually updated to reflect the new hierarchy.

                <h3 class="h4 fw-bold border-bottom pb-2 mb-3 text-body-emphasis">The "Rahoo" Identity</h3>
                <p class="text-body-secondary mb-3">
                    Trent is the living embodiment of The University of the Piedmont's entitled, hyper-masculine lacrosse culture. He performs his "Rahoo" identity with an aggressive, deeply insecure desperation, profoundly wanting to be seen as part of the Charlottesville elite.
                </p>
                <p class="text-body-secondary mb-0">
                    When Trent arrived at the Kids House for the fateful "Honey Chicken Incident," he was dressed in peak late-1990s frat attire: a pastel yellow Ralph Lauren polo shirt with the collar aggressively popped, pleated khakis, a woven leather belt, and sockless boat shoes. He topped it off with a puka shell necklace and Croakies on his sunglasses. To a chaotic, clinically pragmatic household run by women who swear like sailors, Trent's outfit instantly flagged him as prey. Before he even spoke, nineteen-year-old Jessica Brooks had internally diagnosed him as a "sentient country club violation."

                <h3 class="h4 fw-bold border-bottom pb-2 mb-3 text-body-emphasis">The Campus Persona</h3>
                <p class="text-body-secondary mb-3">
                    On the historic lawns of The University of the Piedmont, Trent attempts to project absolute dominance. He aggressively corrects locals who forget to say <em>The</em> University of the Piedmont, and frequently drops "Comm Tech" insults to demean the rival Commonwealth Polytechnic Institute.
                </p>
                <p class="text-body-secondary mb-0">
                    His arrogance gave him a fatal blind spot. Because he was so absorbed in his own campus status, he completely failed to research Chloe's family. He didn't realize that Chloe's aunt, Dr. Katrina Brooks, is a highly respected Tenured Professor at his own university, making the Brooks/Miller family essentially untouchable on his own territory.
                </p>

            <div class="mb-5">
                <h3 class="h4 fw-bold border-bottom pb-2 mb-3 text-body-emphasis text-danger">The Honey Chicken Incident</h3>
                <p class="text-body-secondary mb-3">
                    Trent's relationship with Chloe Brooks abruptly ended on a Friday night in 1999 when his neurotypical insecurity violently clashed with the clinical reality of the Kids House. Uncomfortable with the living room puppy pile and Matt's presence, Trent tried to assert macho camaraderie by eating his takeout like a slob and wiping grease on his khakis.
                </p>
                <p class="text-body-secondary mb-3">
                    When Matt dropped a piece of sticky chicken on his shirt, Chloe and Emily immediately executed a standard, two-point clinical leverage lift to remove the shirt. Trent’s insecure brain conflated the platonic medical transfer with sexual intimacy, and he aggressively grabbed Chloe's shoulder, shouting about "boundaries."
                </p>
                <p class="text-body-secondary mb-0">
                    The Kids House automated security system activated instantly. Sarah (6'4") bulldozed him backward using sheer physical mass. Rachel unleashed a mathematically flawless string of naval artillery profanity. Jessica delivered the kill shot, diagnosing his insecurity by comparing his manhood to a "soggy wonton" while mocking his popped collar. Echo the Husky screamed at him until he was shoved out the front door.
                </p>

            <div class="mb-4">
                <h3 class="h4 fw-bold border-bottom pb-2 mb-3 text-body-emphasis">The Aftermath</h3>
                <p class="text-body-secondary mb-0">
                    Trent attempted to salvage his ego by lying to his lacrosse team about the breakup, claiming he dumped Chloe because her family was "too weird." The lie immediately collapsed. Because Dr. Katrina Brooks is a formidable, tenured anchor at The University of the Piedmont, Trent's fraternity brothers and teammates already knew exactly who her nieces were. No one believed Trent possessed the spine to survive an encounter with the women of the Kids House, cementing his humiliation on campus.
