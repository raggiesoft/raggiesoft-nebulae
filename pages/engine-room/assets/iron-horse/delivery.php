/**
 * ARCHITECTURAL DOCBLOCK
 * 
 * File: pages/engine-room/assets/iron-horse/delivery.php
 * Path: /engine-room/assets/iron-horse/delivery
 * 
 * CORE RESPONSIBILITY:
 * Renders a lore vignette detailing the delivery of the custom-built "Iron Horse" 
 * tour bus (Unit 02). It contrasts the successful, functional engineering of the band's 
 * vehicle with the catastrophic failure of a competitor's luxury coach.
 * 
 * LORE CONTEXT:
 * - The Aftermath of the Negotiation.
 * - Location: Sainte-Claire Coachworks // Québec, Canada
 * - Date: June 2, 2002
 * - Highlights Ryan O'Connell's accessibility requirements (hydraulic lift) and 
 *   Holly O'Connell's over-engineered structural demands.
 * - Includes a "Competitor Intelligence Report" serving as narrative foil.
 * 
 * UI/UX & STYLING ARCHITECTURE:
 * - Relies entirely on standard Bootstrap 5 components and utility classes (cards, 
 *   badges, typography utilities, borders).
 * - Utilizes a distinct dark-mode styling for the "Competitor Intelligence Report" card 
 *   (`.bg-black`, `.border-danger`, `.font-monospace`) to visually separate it as an 
 *   internal dossier.
 * - Uses Phosphor Icons (`ph ph-file-contract`) for iconography.
 * 
 * DEPENDENCIES & INCLUSIONS:
 * - Depends on the parent layout/router to provide the base page structure and CSS.
 * 
 * MAINTENANCE NOTES:
 * - This file represents a standalone narrative vignette. Any structural changes should 
 *   ensure the dramatic pacing of the text blocks remains intact.
 * - No custom CSS is defined here; maintain reliance on Bootstrap 5 utilities to preserve
 *   the global design system.

                        The "Iron Horse" (Unit 02) stood in the center of the bay. It was unpainted stainless steel—a massive, silver monolith. The twenty welders who had built it stood in a semi-circle, arms crossed, waiting.

                        Ryan O'Connell rolled onto the platform. The custom hydraulic system—over-engineered at Holly's insistence—hissed softly. He rose 60 inches into the air, the motion smooth and silent, and rolled into the main cabin.

                        He rolled back out onto the lift and lowered himself down. He looked at the foreman, a man named Jean-Paul.
