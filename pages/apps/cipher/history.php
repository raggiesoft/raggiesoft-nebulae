<!--
 * ARCHITECTURE & MAINTENANCE (LEGACY)
 *
 * This file contains the historical lore and rules explanation for the "Stardust Cipher" (Bulls and Cows) mini-game.
 * 
 * DESIGN INTENT:
 * - Uses standard Bootstrap 5 layouts (container, row, card) to present information chronologically.
 * - Theme utilizes specific Bootstrap utility classes (`text-primary`, `bg-primary-subtle`) to visually categorize eras of the game's history.
 * 
 * MAINTENANCE NOTES:
 * - Content is static. If the game logic in `/apps/cipher` changes, ensure this lore file is updated to reflect accurate rules.
 * - The Phosphor icons (`ph-*`) are heavily relied upon for visual indicators. Ensure the icon library remains loaded in the main template.

                        Long before digital computers or plastic pegs, cryptography enthusiasts played a pencil-and-paper game known as <strong>Bulls and Cows</strong>.

                    <p>
                        The rules were identical to the Stardust Cipher: one player wrote a 4-digit secret number, and the other guessed.

                        In 1970, an Israeli postmaster named Mordecai Meirowitz formalized the game logic into a board game using colored plastic pegs. He pitched it to major toy companies, but many rejected it as "too difficult."

                    <p>
                        It was eventually picked up by <em>Invicta Plastics</em> and became a global phenomenon, selling over 50 million copies. The iconic image of a "mysterious agent" on the box cemented the game's connection to espionage and code-breaking.
